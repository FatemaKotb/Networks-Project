# Project Description
At the beginning of the simulation, the coordinator designates one of the two nodes as the sender, with the other automatically becoming the receiver. The sender possesses a list of messages to transmit to the receiver, each of which is susceptible to one or more errors: loss, modification, duplication, or delay. The simulation employs a variant of the Selective Repeat Data Link Protocol and continues until all messages are received and acknowledged by the receiver.
